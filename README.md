# Kentico Cloud Sample Angular App

This project showcases the use of `Kentico Cloud Delivery Typescript SDK` 

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/kentico-cloud-delivery-typescript-sdk.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kentico-cloud-delivery-typescript-sdk)

in an `Angular` app generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0.

## Installation

Clone/download the repository, navigate to the root folder and install node packages by running:

`npm i`

Once packages are downloaded, you can use Angular commands such as `ng serve` to run the Angular application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
